Read NFC Tag Data with Location

This repository showcases an Android application that reads NFC (Near Field Communication) tags and retrieve specific information, such as PAN (Personal Area Network) ID and Block ID. The project incorporates NFC functionality to interact with NFC tags and retrieve relevant data.

The main functionality of the application involves selecting a PAN ID for a particular location. Once a PAN ID is selected, the application utilizes NFC technology to read the NFC tag and extract additional details associated with the selected PAN ID.

By combining NFC tag reading capabilities with PAN ID selection, this project enables the retrieval of specific information from NFC tags based on the chosen location. It offers a seamless integration of NFC functionality and facilitates the acquisition of additional details related to the selected PAN ID.

This project showcases the utilization of NFC technology, data extraction from NFC tags, and the correlation of NFC data with specific PAN IDs to provide enhanced information retrieval capabilities.

Features
The application utilizes the following features and technologies:

Kotlin Coroutine: Leveraging Kotlin's coroutines to handle asynchronous tasks and streamline concurrency in a more readable and efficient manner.

Kotlin Extensions: Utilizing Kotlin extensions to enhance the functionality and readability of the code by adding custom extension functions and properties.

Custom Extensions: Implementing custom extensions to provide additional utility functions specific to this application's requirements.

Kotlin Flow: Utilizing Kotlin's Flow API to facilitate reactive programming and handle streams of data in a more declarative and composable way.

Data Binding: Utilizing Android Data Binding to establish a connection between the UI components and the underlying data sources, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing the overall efficiency.

Location Service: Incorporating Android's Location Service to retrieve the device's location information, enabling the application to associate the NFC tag data with the device's geographical coordinates.

Coroutine Custom Utils: Implementing custom utility functions and classes to simplify common coroutine-related tasks and improve code reusability and maintainability.

Android Hardware NFC: Utilizing the Android Hardware NFC API to read NFC tag data, allowing the application to interact with NFC tags and retrieve relevant information.
